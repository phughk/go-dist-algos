	// InvokeConsensus – in the client-side library. The decide function takes the list of
	// returned results (the candidate results) and returns a single result,
	//which IR ensures will persist as the consensus result. The application
	//protocol can later recover the consensus result to find out its decision to
	//conflicting operations.
